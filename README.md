Airspace awareness

### About
Previously Naviair was the designated entity responsible for developing and implementing drone infrastructure in Denmark.  
This task was primarily done by the UTM department (Naviair UTM), which was closed as of December 2022, due to missing financial support from Trafikstyrelsen, and Naviair not deciding to fully support the project from  own revenue.  
This means that [Droneluftrum.dk](www.droneluftrum.dk) is to be closed sometime in the future, because Trafikstyrelsen has decided to take over the development by themselves.  
Trafikstyrelsen has decided to implement a full replacement for Droneluftrum, which has been expressed as **lacking a lot** by a majority of stakeholders/interesting entities, and seems to have a lot of limitations in terms of modern software design and future implementations.

In this project, we will try to create a better awareness solution for everyone. 

All collaborators are welcome.
